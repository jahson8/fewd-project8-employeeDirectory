# Employee Directory

This project uses JavaScript (fetch) to capture the details of 12 random persons from the Random User Generator API. The data is formatted and displayed on the page via HTML CSS. The ability to filter through the generated users was also added with JavaScript. The user may click one of these generated users to display a modal. Once open, the user may click the left and right buttons on the modal to cycle through and display a new modal with a different person generated from the data.
